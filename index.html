                    <p class="content_section">The National Museum in New Delhi, established in 1949, is one of the largest and most important 
                        museums in India, offering a rich collection that spans over 5,000 years of Indian history. Its 
                        origins trace back to an exhibition of Indian artifacts organized at the Royal Academy in London 
                        in 1947. Impressed by its success, the Government of India decided to showcase the collection in 
                        Delhi, which eventually led to the foundation of the museum. Initially housed in the Rashtrapati 
                        Bhavan, it moved to its current location in 1960 on Janpath. The museum boasts a vast and diverse 
                        collection that includes sculptures, paintings, textiles, arms, jewelry, and manuscripts from 
                        different periods and regions of India. It holds artifacts from the Harappan Civilization, 
                        intricately carved sculptures from the Maurya and Gupta periods, Mughal miniatures, Chola 
                        bronzes, and artworks from the Gandhara school of art. Over the years, the museum has also 
                        expanded its galleries to include artifacts from Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and other 
                        international collections. Its conservation laboratory is among the finest in the country, 
                        ensuring that the museum's treasures are meticulously preserved. With over 200,000 objects, the 
                        National Museum not only provides a glimpse into the grandeur of India's cultural heritage but 
                        also serves as an educational center, hosting lectures, seminars, and exhibitions that foster 
                        greater appreciation for the arts.</p>

                                    and its journey into the modern era. The museum's sprawling structure, located on
